# BMBF 
For my bachelor's thesis, I developed a project that tackles an unsupervised machine learning problem. The main objective of the thesis is to explore how BMBF (Bundesministerium f√ºr Bildung und Forschung) grants in the BMBF  funding dataset can be grouped using `cluster analysis`. Additionally, the thesis aims to enhance the grants' data by incorporating information from selected sources and examine how data enrichment affects the clustering results.

To achieve these objectives, the research involves investigating various cluster analysis techniques to identify the most suitable one for grouping the grants. The thesis also assesses whether the quality of clustering improves with the data enrichment process. Several sources, including NewsAPI, Crossref, altmetric, and idw (Informationsdienst Wissenschaft), are utilized for data enrichment.

Given that the clustering is performed on text data, the thesis extensively employs `natural language processing` (NLP) techniques. Alongside the `scikit-learn and scipy` for clustering, the thesis utilizes the `nltk` library for text preprocessing. Additionally, other libraries such as `aiohttp, asyncio, and Beautifulsoup` are employed for data enrichment. The crossref_common library is specifically used for extracting open-source data from Crossref.

By leveraging these tools and methodologies, the thesis aims to provide insights into the grouping of BMBF grants through cluster analysis and evaluate the impact of data enrichment on the clustering results.
