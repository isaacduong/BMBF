# BMBF 
This project stems from my bachelor thesis. It tackles unsuperwised machine learning problem.
A major objective of the thesis is to study how BMBF grants in the BMBF funding dataset are grouped using cluster analysis,
as well as how they are enriched with data collected from selected sources in order to analyze their clustering results. 
Furthermore, the research will also be conducted to determine which of the selected cluster analysis is most suitable for grouping the grants
and to analyze whether the data enrichment has any effect on improving the clustering quality. 
The NewsAPI, Crossref, altmetric and idw (Informationsdienst Wissenschaft) are sources that will be used for data enrichment.
The thesis involved working with some clustering techniques such as k-means clustering, agglomerative hierachical clustering and DBSCAN, applying on 
text data. NLP, therefore, is part of the thesis. Besides the  Sklearn API, which is used for clustering, many other librabies such as Beautifulsoup for data enrichment, crossref_common for pulling opensource datas from Crossref etc.
